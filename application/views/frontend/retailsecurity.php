<p>A combination of an unstable economic climate, high unemployment figures and a decreased desire to work, the retail business is often an industry that becomes vulnerable. As people turn to the likes of theft and fraud to counteract the above issues unfortunately it’s your business that suffers the consequences both financially and reputably. But this shouldn’t and doesn’t have to be the case. Ensuring you have a robust retail security solution in place from an expert security company is the only way you can keep your stock from the prying hands of thieves and vandals. This is why here at PESS Ltd we have a range of retail security solutions and loss prevention methods to ensure you are never the victim:<br></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc !important;">
<li>Online CCTV Monitoring</li>
<li>Static Security Guards</li>
<li>Theft Deterrence</li>
<li>Liaising with Police</li>
<li>Handling of Suspicious Individuals - Professionally and Subtly</li>
<li>Key Holding</li>
<li>Supplying and Fitting of Alarm Systems</li>
</ul>
 
<p>With only a relatively small percentage of theft resulting in criminal prosecution, it’s all too easy for members of the public and even your own staff to walk away with your goods. In cases where the outcome results in a conviction you’ll only ever receive compensation for the cost of your stolen items so inevitably you’ll still be out of pocket when it comes to your court fees and the loss of business it may have caused you. Here at PESS our retail security services are designed with you and your needs in mind.<br><br>

Providing that visual deterrence your store needs and a watchful eye over your stock, we’ll equip you with professional store security guards that are capable of handling and diffusing any suspicious activity and if needs be detaining any criminals until the authorities arrive. Our expert guards assisted with unbeatable CCTV means that you’ll also have the irrefutable evidence on hand to give you every chance of winning your case.<br><br>

If you want to keep your stock out of reach of thieves and keep your losses to a minimum, then invest in a name you van trust with PESS.</p>
