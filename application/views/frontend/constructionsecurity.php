Offering the complete package we can tailor the below construction security services to your exact needs.<br></p>

</ul>
 
<p>With twenty years’ experience in the security industry we understand just how vulnerable construction sites can be and know exactly what measures need to be put in place to ensure that this is not the case. With expensive equipment, tools and materials often left unattended, construction sites make for the perfect opportunity not only for thieves and vandals but also make for a hazardous danger zone for unsuspecting children who simply see your site as a playground. By choosing a construction security solution from PESS you can relax safe in the knowledge you have done all you can to keep your site secure so that your expensive materials and machinery won’t be damaged or go walkabout.<br><br>


When you and your employees pack up and leave for the day the last thing you’ll want to be thinking about is whether or not your equipment and hard work will be as it was when you left it. This is why we have a robust system in place with the likes of shift operated mobile patrols which can operate through the night when you’re not there and when your site is consequently most susceptible.<br><br>


So get in touch with PESS today and we’ll create, monitor and manage a building site security service that allows you to get on with the job at hand without ever worrying about your security.</p>
