<p>Industrial premises often pose many challenges when it comes to security. From construction sites, warehouses to factories that are often vast, open air, remote locations it can be extremely challenging to secure these areas. With this in mind here at PESS we have invested our years of expertise and experience into devising industrial security solutions that overcome these obstacles and provide you with the protection and safety your industrial site needs.<br><br>
With material theft on the rise and industrial sites often located away from the passing public or local authorities, it’s down to you and you alone to ensure that you’ve got the security of your site covered by a company you can trust. This is why here at PESS we will survey your industrial building or site so that we understand exactly where you’re most at risk and can implement the correct procedures to keep all that’s important to you free from damage and theft. With a variety of services we’ll work with you to decide which would be most beneficial and tailor these services to provide you with the best level of protection. Whether it’s mobile patrols your industrial building needs to cover every inch of your site or it’s a static guard you need to keep watch over a particularly susceptible area, we have the solution.<br><br>
Leaving abandoned, valuable equipment and materials lying around overnight with no sign of security in place is a criminal’s heaven. This is why half the challenge is ensuring you’ve got the deterrence factor in place to avoid any criminal activity in the first place. Equipping your site with not only active CCTV and industrial security guards, but fencing and security signs is a positive way of directing any potential criminals away from your site.<br><br>
If you want to stop being an easy target then hire security for industrial buildings with the experts from PESS today.</p>

<p>A combination of an unstable economic climate, high unemployment figures and a decreased desire to work, the retail business is often an industry that becomes vulnerable. As people turn to the likes of theft and fraud to counteract the above issues unfortunately it’s your business that suffers the consequences both financially and reputably. But this shouldn’t and doesn’t have to be the case. Ensuring you have a robust retail security solution in place from an expert security company is the only way you can keep your stock from the prying hands of thieves and vandals. This is why here at PESS Ltd we have a range of retail security solutions and loss prevention methods to ensure you are never the victim:<br></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc !important;">
<li>Online CCTV Monitoring</li>
<li>Static Security Guards</li>

<li>Liaising with Police</li>
<li>Handling of Suspicious Individuals - Professionally and Subtly</li>
<li>Key Holding</li>
<li>Supplying and Fitting of Alarm Systems</li>

<p>With only a relatively small percentage of theft resulting in criminal prosecution, it’s all too easy for members of the public and even your own staff to walk away with your goods. In cases where the outcome results in a conviction you’ll only ever receive compensation for the cost of your stolen items so inevitably you’ll still be out of pocket when it comes to your court fees and the loss of business it may have caused you. Here at PESS our retail security services are designed with you and your needs in mind.<br><br>

Providing that visual deterrence your store needs and a watchful eye over your stock, we’ll equip you with professional store security guards that are capable of handling and diffusing any suspicious activity and if needs be detaining any criminals until the authorities arrive.
